I think sed is pretty useful.
SED command in UNIX is stands for stream editor and it can perform lotâ€™s of function on file like, searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion. 

For example:

### Sed command is mostly used to replace the text in a file.

### Replacing the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line.
